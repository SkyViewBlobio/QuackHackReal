> [!CAUTION]
> This client "Hack" will no longer receive updates and therefore is no longer paid/private. 

This project was specifically targeted towards the Minecraft anarchy scene. It features lightweight renders, unique combat modules, exploits, utility modules, and some packet management. The overall goal was to give the user a smooth experience while also covering all topics. The client was apparently mostly popular for its render modules and advanced combat modules. 

The client supports exploits in normal and modded Minecraft:
Silent-switch, wall ESP, EntityESP, ItemESP, AutoCrystal, WeaknessSwitch, CssP manipulation, crystalpvp.cc alternative PCritical packet bypass, strafe bypasses on popular 1.8 Servers, and so on.

You are free to use the code and/or reupload.
